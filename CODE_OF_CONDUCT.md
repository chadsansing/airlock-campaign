#Airlock campaign Code of Conduct

We've adopted Mozilla's Community Participation Guidelines for this campaign. [Please read them here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) before playing.

Key guidelines include:

- Be direct but constructive; we cannot withhold hard truths.
- Be inclusive and help all players be heard.
- Appreciate and accommodate our many cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs among players and characters.
- Be open to learning from others.
- Lead by example and match your actions with your words.
- The following will not be tolerated between game masters, players, and any other people involved in this campaign: violence and threats of violence; personal attacks; derogatory language; unwelcome sexual attention or physical contact; disruptive behaviour; influencing unacceptable behaviour.

We will also use the X card, line, and veil to calibrate content and make a safe playspace for players.

If you have questions or concerns, please direct them to [Chad Sansing](mailto:csansing@fmail.com).
