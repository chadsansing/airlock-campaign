# *Adjudication space* wold-building

Also know as *Deadeye*, *The decision game*, and *Old Testament Jesus and his space commandos!*

## Maxims

- Adjudicators. Adjudicators and players don't need to agree. The strongest party preserves and applies a diversity of thought to the problems presented in a game, as in life.
- Treaty is a synonym for law, especially for a law that crosses planets.
- Decisions should be made at the most local level possible.
- Government is like a holacracy. Each planet is a cell including cells based on cultures, geography, and guilds.
- Culture cells are super-cells of subcultures.
- Geography cells are super-cells of regions, which are super cells of localities.
- There are often alliances between people in a culture who live in a geography and depend on particular guilds for survival.
- Guild cells are super-cells of guild members from geographies and cultures.
- Planet-wide security and law-enforcement cells exist to deal with non-crisis/non-governance-related issues. Each rep is assigned to a culture, geography, or guild distant from their birth cell so they have to trust one another to equitably, fairly, and justly serve each others' families, though they are no forced to leave their home planets.
- No one can serve on any two types of planetary cell at once, though an individual can be a planetary cell rep, a culture, geography, or guild rep. and a sub-cell rep.
- Cross-planet cells exist. 
- Each planet can be in many cross-planet cells.
- A system-wide super cell writes treaties that each cell must ratify down to the planet level. Because each planet-level cell is a super cell of cultures, geographies, & guilds, it works.
- When a problem cannot be resolved up to the planetary level or when there is an interplanetary crisis, the adjudicators are called.
- Players play the adjudicators. They are like a systems-wide circuit of supreme court justices hearing arguments, making decisions, enforcing them, and dealing with the consequences.
- They are cells of executives from different philosophies of government and mysticism to preserve diveristy of thought. They are expected to uphold the treaties, but are not bound to them in their enforcement of the treaties.
- They cannot belong to any cell, ever, apart from their cell of 3 or 5 adjudicators, each from a different school and system.
- They alone can bear weapons in adjudications.
- They alone police themselves.
- Their decisions do not become precedent or treaty, though they are free to travel from planet to planet or system to system ruling the same way in each similar case.
- Because of their freedom from dependencies and expectations, there are schools of thought, mysticism, and technology available to them that are not allowed, by treaty, among the general populace.
- The world-building with PCs involves defining 5 or 6 sectors, typiucally 1 or 2 per player, Y planets and planet-cells in each sector, and Z culture, geography, and guild cells per planet.
- Each of the 5 sectors is also home to 1 school of adjudicator, and the player from each sector defines their school, its philosophy of government, its mystic traditions, and its technology. The technology, alone, flavors the rest of the sector in noticeable forms - aesthetic, not mechanical.
- The definition of a school should influence its adherents' stats, powers, relationships, inventories, aesthetics, and playstyles.

## Case studies

- When making a character and defining your school, decide, document, and share how your school would react to each case-study below:
  - Planetary culture and geography cells have conspired to let native citizens act as security and law-enforcement in their home geographies. Guild cells have turned a blind eye and blocked consideration of the matter at the planetary cell level because the planet is especially profitable for their cross-planet guild cell. All three guilds are therefore in violation of treaties governing the disposition of security and law enforcement forces and cells, but none of the cells are in conflict with one another, and no other planets know about this arrangement because of the interference of theguild cells. How would your school resolve this conflict if none of the parties agreed to obey existing treaties governing market manipulation?
  - A conspiracy of planetary guild cells and a junta of security and law enforcement cells have agreed to conspire to break labor laws and exploit culture and geography guilds by theat of force to make the guild members and security and law enforcement cell members wealthy. An insurrection of culture and geography cells has waged violent resistance against the guild and security and law enforcment cells, leading to multiple deaths. Neither the exploitation of workers nor armed insurrection are permitted by treaty. How would your school resolve this conflict if none of the parties agreed to obey existing treaties governing labor and use of force?
  - A culture cell within a particular geography has begun teaching mystical traditions outlawed by treaty and refuses to obey security and law-enforcment cells in the area. Native security and law enforcement cell members are deserting their assigned geographies to return "home" to defend their culture cells from the local security and law enforcement cells. How would your school resolve this conflict if the culture cell refused to stop its teaching and its security and law enforcement members refused to return to their assigned posts?
- Your school's position relative to each case should influence its adherents' stats, powers, relationships, inventories, aesthetics, and playstyles.

## Party composition

- You should play Adjudication space with 3 or 5 players to avoid tied decisions. The big idea is to enforce a majority decision with a unitied will after each adjudication, to practice reasoning according to PCs' schools, to preserve and appreciate diversity of thought, and to work together despite differences to define and enact the most equitable, fair, and just outcome possible in each adjudication. And to fight your way out when locals object and break treaties made against violence.
- If you have 3 players, have each define 2 sectors in your system. Play in a 6-sector system. One sector should be for their school; the other should be some kind of rival or opposite to create tension and hooks in the campaign.
- If you have 5 players, have each define 1 sector in the system. Play in a 5-sector system, or let the GM create a central-government system or rogue system or forbidden or mystery system - something to increase the tension and number of campaign hooks available to players.

## Sector composition

- "Planet" could mean any habitable settlement, whether its a planet, a space station, or fleet.
- Each planet should have local culture, geography, and guild cells.
- Each planet should have a planetary cell made up of reps from those cells.
- Each planet should have a security and law enforcement cell.
- Each sector should have a sector cell made up of reps from planetary cells.
- Each system should have a cell made up of reps from sector cells.
- The system cell makes treaties for system cells to bring to their planet cells for ratification after discussion by local cells.
- Planets can be sanctioned for refusing to ratify a treaty, as can sectors.
- Planets in a sector can be complementary, all capabvle of sustaning their poplaces and working together to export a single commodity to the system.
- Planets in a sector can be interdependent, all depending on another for something necessary to sustain their populations or process an commodity they export to the system.
- Planets in a sector can be suspciious of one another and aloof, competitive, or distant from each other while operating within (and pushing against) the boundaries of treaties as each works to export one or more commodities.

## Schools

- Schools can be academies that deliver the same curriculum and experience across planets. 
- Schools can be loosely federated and run by individual and idisyncratic masters on different planets, each fully graduating trusted adjudicators in an overarching tradition.
- Schools can be sites on different planets organized into "chambers" or parts of a pilgrimage an ajudicator needs to complete to graduate.
- Schools can follow other cross-sector or otherwise intra-system models imagined by GMs and players.

## Campaigns

- Campaigns should consist of the dramatic resolution of conflicts created during world-building or caused by PCs' actions.
- Alternately, a campaign could follow any number of students of the same school trying to graduate from it while adjudicating conflicts within single cells on their planets.
