Picking up from scene 1, session 1...

# Session 2

**SPOILER ALERT:** PCs, you should not read any further. The session notes are for GMs, not players or their voidnauts.

## Chatter aboard *the Ibis Feather*

- **Bicep:** *No one on Molalla would have ever tried to break a deal like that,* or, *It’s a good thing the Ibis Feather was around to save Illyum.*
- **Godiva:** *I am going to shut down the next ship that makes me teleport to it during a battle,* or, *The worst part of that entire ordeal was getting the smell of so much iron ore off my gear after teleporting to that ship.*
- **Guppy:** *It’s good that the miners saw they couldn’t deal unfairly with Illyum,* or, *Perhaps we should visit that accident in the mining belt to make sure nothing illegal is happening.*
- **Merino:** *I thought taking the job was going to be boring, but if we get to take over ships and teleport back and forth between them at will, I could get used to this adjudication thing,* or, *I’m surprised by how much adjudicating is just like piracy so far.*
- **Wrench:** *That was really the best possible outcome; it would have been such a pain to recycle that hauler if we’d blown it out of the sky,* or, *With that mining accident, Guppy, you may want to suggest Illyum buys recycled metals from Attis.*

## Scene 1

### Type

Combat or Evasion

### Conflict

As soon as the PCs have resolved the conflict above Illyum, they're called to [nearby planet]. A team of Adjudicators just declared the death sentence for a law encorcement cell members found guilty of using excessive force against the local population during a labor dispute, resulting the the death of 5 cilvilians. 

His peers rejected the Adjudicators' judgment and attacked them to prevent the execution. The Adjudicators need extraction from the spaceport. Their ship has been disabled. The planet cell is organizing a response to put down the mutiny and restore order, but it will take more time than the Adjudicators have to mount a response. The PCs need to fly in, secure a dock against the local law enforcement mutineers, and cover for their peers until everyone is aboard *the Ibis Feather.*

The Adjudicators are hholed up in a locked cargo bay on Attis. The PCs have to fight their way to them.

There are 4 local law enforcement mutineers sent to intercept the PCs. They have ballistic rifles. 3 danger each.

If this is played as an Evasion scene, the objectives are 10 waypoints each.

- Get to the Adjudicators.
- Hold the door while you open it.
- Get back to the ship.

### Outcome(s)

- The PCs defeat the mutineers and free the Adjudicators.
- The PCs find another way out of the situation and turn this into an Intrigue scene (Cease fire --> no way this ends well --> surrender --> Wait for the planetary cell instead of running).

### Reward(s)

- -5 fatigue.
- Combat or Evasion means.

## Scene 2

### Type

**Optional:** Evasion (only if the previous scene was combat).

### Conflict

The PCs need to get the Adjudicators back to *the Ibis Feather.*

The alarm is 4. 

This is just a 10-waypoint escape back to the ship with the PCs responsible for the Adjudicators danger levels, as well. Each round with the Adjudicators' danger at 10 results in one being captured.

### Outcome(s)

- Any number of Adjudicators makes it off [planet] out of the 3 assigned to this case.
- No Adjudicators out of those 3 make it off planet.
- The PCs all make it off planet.
- The PCs lose a teammate.

### Reward

- -5 fatigue
- Evasion means.
- Raise a talent a level.

## Next time on Adjudication Space...

After dropping off the other Adjudicators on [planet/ship/station], the PCs get an urgent transmission.

"*Ibis Feather*, make haste to these coordinates and prepare to intercept unknown object inbound from unmapped sector of Amnir's Wall. Scan the object, report back, and await further instruction." Long range scans show up on the ship's monitors. The unknown object looks like a ship.
