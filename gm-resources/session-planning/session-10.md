# Session 10

## Chatter

## Scene 1

The PCs must escape Petra and **Shut's** exotic matter dreadnaught and run the outer asteroid belt blockade in order to reach the wormhole to the Harvest system, last known location of the *Osiris*.

### Type

Crew

### Conflict

The PCs have to finish off the pursuing dreadnaught and escape the system.

### Outcome(s)

- The PCs escape pursuit and take the wormhole to follow the generation ship *Osiris* into the Harvest system.
- The PCs begin their search for the generation ship *Osiris* and evade **Shut's** forces in the system.

### Reward(s)

- A new Crew means related to the ship.

## Scene 2

The PCs must find a way to locate the sleeping generation ship *Osiris* in the vast, dark Harvest system, the main sequence star of which **Shut** has enclosed in a Dyson sphere.

### Type

Intrigue

### Conflict

The PCs have to find a way to seach for the *Osiris* or make contact with it. Looking around will take the rest of their natural lives, and the sensors and signals suites of the *Pr Djed* are powerful, but not powerful enough to sweep a signifant volume of this system all at once.

It's also likely that Shut is in pursuit, though how much of the exotic matter planetoid in Petra Shut controls after losing its dreadnaugt may not be enough to martial a vessel or fleet capable of defeating the *Pr Djed*.

### Outcome(s)

The PCs, in consultation with **Rin** find a way to sweep a massive volume of the system at once or to send an incredibly powerful signal across the system to locate the *Osiris*. Perhaps they crack the Dyson Sphere and use the enclosed star as a massive amplifier or repeater for their message or sensors.

### Reward(s)

+1 Intrigue rank.

## Scene 3

The PCs make contact with the Osiris.

### Type

Evasion

### Conflict

Once the *Osiris* makes itself known, it's a race between the PCs forces and **Shut's** forces to reach the ship and either awaken or kill its sleepers. **Rin** will have its own ideas of what to do with them.

The PCs must board the vessel and sneak into engineering or the bridge to take control of the ship from **Shut's** boarding proxies.

### Outcome(s)

The PCs get to decide what to do with the *Osiris* and its manifest of ancient, sleeping passengers.

Those passengers will likely not be willing to deal with **Rin**.

### Reward(s)

+1 Evasion rank.

## Next time on Adjudication Space...

PCs might:

- Wake the sleepers.
- Decide how to fight **Shut** and end its threat.
- Decide how to deal with **Rin**.
