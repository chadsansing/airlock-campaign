## Chatter

## Scene 1

### Type

Evasion

### Conflict

The *Osiris* can be controlled from engineering or the bridge. The PCs have to beat Shut's proxies to one terminal or another before Shut kills the sleeping humans.

### Outcome(s)

The PCs control the *Osiris* and its cargo of suspended humans from 20000 years ago.

### Reward(s)

+1 rank to an Evasion op.

## Scene 2

### Type

Combat

### Conflict

Shut's avatar infiltrates the ship with violence of action across the territory objective, or maybe it forms suddenly from an amalgamof the remaining Shut proxies on the *Osiris*. The PCs have to defeat a levianthan of exotic matter springing mono-filament tentacles and "breathing" beams and clouds of radiation at them. Shut will kill the party if they don't destroy the avatar in a few turns or take the Phoenix Protocol. CHROME SPAZE DARGON!

### Outcome(s)

Having lost its dreadnaught, the Harvest system Dyson Sphere, and its avatar, Shut kust regroup and spend belt cycles thinking of next steps and the resource allocations needed for them, giving the PCs a clear passage back into Petra and freedom to act for the next scene or ession.

### Reward(s)

+1 combat voidnetic manifests itself from the stress and resolution of this conflict.

***We stopped here.***

## Scene 3

### Type

Crew

### Conflict

If there's time to run this scene, the PCs will have to escape Petra and make it back to Cantor before their chosen doomsday weapon (the *Pr Djed's* core or its Xeno's Paradox device) destroys Petra or closes the wormhole to Cantor. 

### Outcome(s)

The PCs return home as heroes, but no one outside the System Cell knows it. They're pulled into negotiations immediately to decide the fate of any surviving suspended humans and any remaining Rin proxies aboard their ship.

### Reward(s)

+1 Crew passage: "Remember that time we killed Shut?"

## Next time on Adjudication Space...

The PCs should enact a strategy to end Shut's threat if they didn't have time last session. Then they must get the *Osiris* to safety in the Cantor system and help the System Cell negotiate a treaty to govern the humans in stasis and any remaining Rin proxies, knowing that the humans who wake up will remember Rin from their war against the robots.

Finally, an epilogue or outro will end this chapter of...ADJUDICATION SPACE!
