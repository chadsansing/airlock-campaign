Picking up from our free-play cliffhanger, session 2...

# Session 3

**SPOILER ALERT:** PCs, you should not read any further. The session notes are for GMs, not players or their voidnauts.

## Chatter aboard *the Ibis Feather*

- **Bicep:** *We’ve gotta be ready for whatever comes out of that wormhole next,* or, *That thing didn’t look so tough; it wasn’t even armed.*
- **Godiva:** *We need to establish contact with whatever brought that person here,* or, *Without knowing more about what that was and what it wants, it’s too early to pursue contact.*
- **Guppy:** *I was looking forward to some salvage,* or, *When I look at this person, I feel strange to see what we once were.*
- **Merino:** *I thought maybe we would find treasure, but I never thought we’d find a body,* or, *Can you imagine the wealth and technology that *must be on the other side of the wormhole?*
- **Wrench:** *I’ve never seen a machine that could take itself apart like that and still somehow work,* or, *What does this mean for us - for all of us?*

## Scene 1

### Type

Crew

### Conflict

The system cell has ordered a communicationsa blackout regarding the true nature of the alien incursion. Adjudication HQ is upset, but has no way to challenge the ruling since there is no conflict here. 

The official story is that an alien probe came through the wormhole and then went back through. It seems technologically advanced, but unarmed, and peaceful. The system anticipates advancing its science significantly by studying its record of the probe's journey through the Cantor system.

The system cell orders Adjudication HQ to send the approaching back-up vessels after *the Ibis Feather*. The ship will be boarded and its adjudicators imprisoned or perhaps killed. None of the other adjudicators know what the crew saw - the only knew they were ordered to support the ship, and then board it and imprison its crew. The crew has been ordered to be silent, as well.

One of Merino's mentors is at Adjudicator HQ; an ancient diplomat; she sends a warning: the implications of this event are too big for the system not to try to control. They will silence you. They are not interested in diplomacy, but in keeping the system from upheaval, panic, and superstitious reverie. Follow the probe. Run! Find the thing that will make them negotiate with you - information!

Their colleagues, including the 3 adjudicators they rescured from Attis, are aboard the following ships:

- *The Market Correction*.
- *The Justice Worm*.
- *The Salvage Tax*.
- *The Notion in Amber*. This is the ship beloning to the Adjudicators the PCs rescued on Attis.
- *The Patient Millenium*.

### Outcome(s)

- The PCs evade their peers and jump through the woremhole from Cantor to Petra. 
- They see the true nature of the system. The planet in the habitable zone is actually a sphere of exotic material like the ship. An inner asteroid belt surrounds the wormhole and star. An outer one impeded access to wormholes leading out of the system to parts unknown.

### Reward(s)

- -5 fatigue.
- The PCs get to raise a Crew skill by 1.

## Scene 2

### Type

Combat

### Conflict

- A signal comes from an asteroid in the inner belt - the same mathematical pattern used by the exotic probe.
- A single Rin proxy is being destroyed by a group of Shut proxies.
- The signal is clearly coming from the Rin proxy.
- Save the robot!

### Outcome(s)

- The PCs make enemies with Shut.
- The PCs make contact with Rin.
- The PCs learn that Rin has been protecting them, but they have to learn about Shut to warn their people. Shut is about to win (in a few millenia).
- The PCs get to question the Rin proxy in the next scene.

### Reward

- -5 fatigue
- The PCs get to raise a Combat skill by 1.

## Scene 3

### Type

Intrigue

### Conflict

- The PCs identify 4 essential things they want to learn from the Rin proxy before it loses coherence and disintegrates back into exotic dust bound for the planetoid and recycling.
- They have 5 rounds to make it as far as they can, with each question becoming more difficult for the proxy to answer (pressue 2, 2, 3, 4; talking points 10, 10, 15, 20).

### Outcome(s)

- The PCs make enemies with Shut.
- The PCs make contact with Rin.
- The PCs learn that Rin has been protecting them, but they have to learn about Shut to warn their people. Shut is about to win (in a few millenia).
- The PCs get to question the Rin proxy in the next scene.

### Reward

- -5 fatigue
- The PCs get to raise an Intrigue skill by 1. 

## Next time on Adjudication Space...

Will the PCs begin ops against Shut or try to travel home to defy the system cell and warn their peoples?
