# Session 8

Rin helps the PCs board and wake the *Pr Djed*, an ancient human ship with a doomsday weapon capable of dealing with Shut.

## Chatter

- **Godiva:** *What do we do next?* or, *If we beat Shut, how do we deal diplomatically with Rin?*
- **Merino:** *I feel like we need someone to cause a distraction*, or, *If we beat Shut, the first thing I'm going to do is....*
- **Bicep:** *My top 5 doomsday weapons, in no particular order*, or, *Anybody else wonder if we should follow a robot into the sun?*
- **Guppy:** *How do we keep a ship secret from the rest of the system?*, or, *If we board that ship, I think we should claim it as ours.*
- **Wrench:** *What do you think is aboard that ship?*, or, *I wonder what we'll find left over from our ancestors.*

## Scene 1

Waking the *Pr Djed*.

### Type

Crew

### Conflict

The PCs must reach and board the *Pr Djed* before Cantor's star incinerates the *Ibis Feather*. The storytelling here should concern the PCs making it to 20 waypoints each while:

- Piloting between flares and celestial winds full of radiation.
- Using the shields to keep everyone from being poisoned and irradiated or melted to death.
- Using the signals to keep the ship's sensors functional while filtering out the noise of the star's coronal ejections.
- Using the ships guns to provide extra thrust.
- Using engineering to cool and power the ship enough to reach the *Pr Djed*.

So, there will be no enemy ships to add harm to, but PCs will need to move through 20 waypoints as if they were doing harm. This is a hybrid crew/evasion scene.

PCs have 5 rounds + Phoenix Protocol rounds at Chop 4 to get to the new ship and board it before the *Ibis Feather* explodes and vaporizes.

Rin can lower the ship's shields for an instant when it's time to board ("We greatly compromised the security of human ships during our confilct.")- if the *Ibis Feather* can get close enough, **Godiva** should be able to teleport everyone aboard at close range at once.

### Outcome(s)

- The PCs get a new ship, the precursor frigate *Pr Djed*, that will help them in their battle against Shut.
 
### Reward(s)

- The PCs get a new ship, the *Pr Djed*, with an advanced drive, disruptor beams that add +1 success per gunnery roll, and a Zeno's Paradox doomsday weapon.

## Scene 2

"There are multiple frigate sized ships coming through the wormhole and attacking mining operations in Amnir's wall. They seem to be landing on asteroids."

Rin: "Oh no."

### Type

Crew

### Conflict

Shut has run Rin's blockade with 3 frigates that are attempting to land on Amnir's Wall and turn the asteroid belt into a beachhead for its decentralized consciousness.

The PCs must obliterate the ships and return to Petra to keep more from coming through, or else destroy the wormhole.

### Outcome(s)

- Cantor is safe for now.
- The wormhole is closed and Rin joins the PCs, or the PCs travel back to Petra to confront Shut, flying into an ongong battle surrounding the wormhole that gives them cover to act.

### Reward(s)

- A new voidnetic and a new talent activated by the expansion of their consciousness,m travel through the wormhole, and repeated exposure to exotic matter and radiation.

## Next time on Adjudication Space...

- The PCs take their next step against Shut!
