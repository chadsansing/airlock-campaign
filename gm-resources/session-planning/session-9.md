# Session 9

## Chatter

## Scene 1

"There are multiple frigates coming through the wormhole and attacking mining operations in Amnir's wall. They seem to be landing on asteroids."

### Type

Crew

### Conflict

Shut has run Rin's blockade with 3 frigates that are attempting to land on Amnir's Wall and turn the asteroid belt into a beachhead for its decentralized consciousness.

The PCs must obliterate the ships and return to Petra to keep more from coming through, or else destroy the wormhole.

### Outcome(s)

- Cantor is safe for now.
- The wormhole is closed and Rin joins the PCs, or the PCs travel back to Petra to confront Shut, flying into an ongong battle surrounding the wormhole that gives them cover to act.

### Reward(s)

- A new voidnetic and a new talent inspired by the PCs' adventures.

## Scene 2

The PCs take the battle back to Shut in the Petra system.

### Type

This will most likely be a crew scene.

### Conflict

PCs may adopt one or more of several strategies for dealing with Shut, including:

- Running the outer asteroid belt blockade for a wormhole into another system in hope of finding a generation ship.
- Detonating the *Pr Djed's* core in the Shut asteroid belt.
- Detonating the *Pr Djed's* core near the exotic matter planetoid.
- Detonating the *Pr Djed's* core in the wormhole to Cantor.
- Activating the Zeno's Paradox doomsday weapon.

Part of the conflict will be deciding whether or not to try and escape the system if PCs detonate the ship or its weapon.

***We left off here with PCs fleeing a Shut Dreadnaught pursuit as they attempted to run the system and escape through the middle wormhole and follow the*** Osiris***.***

### Outcome(s)

The PCs will likely wind up in one of the following situations. They might wind up:

- WHurtling through a dark, alien system searching for a hidden generation ship running silent.
- Sacrificing themselves to neutralize Shut.
- Detonating their ship's core or its weapon in Petra while fleeing back to Cantor.

### Reward(s)

Rewards might include:

- A new crew means specific to the *Pr Djed*.
- A new character.
- A new passage.

## Next time on Adjudication Space...

PCs might:

- Look for their ancestors.
- Begin again.
