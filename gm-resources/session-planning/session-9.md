Shut has run Rin's blockade with 3 frigates that are attempting to land on Amnir's Wall and turn the asteroid belt into a beachhead for its decentralized consciousness.

The PCs must obliterate the ships and return to Petra to keep more from coming through, or else destroy the wormhole.

### Outcome(s)

- Cantor is safe for now.
- The wormhole is closed and Rin joins the PCs, or the PCs travel back to Petra to confront Shut, flying into an ongong battle surrounding the wormhole that gives them cover to act.

### Reward(s)

- A new voidnetic and a new talent inspired by the PCs' adventures.
