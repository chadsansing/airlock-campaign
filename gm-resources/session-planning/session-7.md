# Session 7

Remind Godiva and Merino that they have cleared their relationship so it can be restoked. Remind Godiva and Merino to add a rank to an Evasion skill. Invite PCs to recap the last session for one another while on route to Attis.

There is a robot wearing gloves, shoulderpads, a helmet, and a sports jersey on the *Ibis Feather*.

## Chatter

- **Godiva:** *What did we miss?*, or, *What is this robot?*
- **Merino:** *What are we going to tell the Systems Cell?*, or, *We need a plan that doesn't get us killed.*
- **Bicep:** *I think a direct confrontation would work best*, or, *I say we go get weapons from those generation ships to fight Shut.*
- **Guppy:** *I think we should tell the cell the truth*, or, *I think we need to keep some information from the cell.*
- **Wrench:** *Maybe we could make more Rins*, or, *Maybe we could learn from how Rin fights Shut.*

## Scene 1

Debrief on Attis

### Type

Ingtrigue

### Conflict

- The Systems Cell wants to find an excuse to imprison the PCs indefinitely to hide the truth: someone sent a human body from millenia ago through the wormhole.
- The Systems Cell wants to deny the PCs' report; it challenges the foundations of their beliefs too much. They believe life originated in this system and that the development of its Holacracy allowded for peaceful evolution, diversification, and specialization. The truth is that human survivors from the robots' war of liberation came here in such small numbers that they could erase their history and expand without competing for resources. They were a math problem to ensure surival, not a clever cadre of social engineers and lawyers. They created meme and myths that perservere to this day.
- The Systems Cell needs to be convinced of a plan that does not throw the system into Chaos and allows it to plan for the gradual release of new information over time as it sees fit; they can reckon with the military threat Shut poses, but not the existential one.
- The Systems Cell need to be convinced to put the PCs and their robot in charge of the defense of Cantor.

The first 2 agendas are 20-pointers at Pressure 3, and the second 2 are 15-pointers at Pressure 2. This shift represents the Systems Cell calming down while the PCs get out from under the threat of imprisonment or death.

There are five representatives from the System Cell here along with a security force the PCs did not expect to exist. Kind of like a security detail, rather than an army, but sizeable and mobile. Someything like, but other than the Adjudicators. Enforcers? Executioners?

- *The idealist:* **Levi of Illyum**, a rare orange/red/brown genotype Illian, known for her application of restorative justice at sea.
	- "If these Adjudicators can propose a way to fix this problem themselves, I am predisposed to free them to do their work."
- *The capitalist:* **Quad of Mollala**, whose enduring defense of corporate personhood is know throughout the cells.
	- "It is better to risk ruin than guarantee it. I would rather bury these events than see their impact on our markets."
- *The undecided:* **Juniper of Terra Nova**, Judge of Judges, whose decisions cannot be anticipated because of her storied impartiality.
	- "For me, the crux of the issue lies in what they knew when and how they responded."
- *The survivalist:* **Admiral Lime**, the Pirate, who asserts the needs of the fleet over those of a ship.
	- "The brig. Until we decide what to do for the system. We do what's best for Cantor."
- *The pragmatist:* **Chief Barrister Coil of Attis**, whose assessment of newly proposed treaties and systems against both precedent and public opinion are trusted by all.
	- "No one else knows what they know, only that they fled. The cells are looking for stability. Our solution must punish them somehow while serving the system's needs."

Rin will volunteer the following when it comes time to plan:

- There is a single precursor ship left in Petra. The *Pr Djed*. It has been locked in a synchronous orbit relative to your sun's core and hidden inside your star's coronoa for the past 20000 years.
- It possesses a doomsday weapon that will stop Shut and preserve humanity, but at great cost. It produces a Zeno's Paradox effect that halves the acceleration of any object caught in its field. The field is ever expanding. The PCs could, for example, detonate the weapon in the Petra system, attempt to flee back to Cantor, and then destroy the wormhole. This would ensure that the expansion of the field would take thousands and thousands of millenia to arrive here. It would freeze Shut in time, but also the other wormhole systems and neighboring space as the field expands. Because movement will collapse, there may also be an unintended phenomenological effec that copllapses affected space from three dimensions into two once movement can no longer be observed by any existing observer. We allowed the humans such a weapon anticipating a possible eventuality in which we were unable to protect them from Shut. Our hope was that they would preserve theior galaxy in a kind of temporal amber keeping Shut out until such time as a more advanced civilization could disacover and rescue them from their time capsule of sorts.
- It also possesses a drive much more advanced than yours that may be used to create singularity the PCs could use to destroy the star in the Petra system (and may or may not overload and collapse the nearby wormhole to Cantor) or the exotic matter planetoid. The doomsday weapon is likewise integrated into the ship, so if the ship does not escape Cantor before the blast, it may be destroyed and the doomsday weapon may then trigger, also. Destroying either the star (which will also destroy Rin) or the planetoid will limit the resources available to Shut and delay its plan.
- It may also be possible to use this ship to run Shut's blockade of the other wormholes and to explore those systems in hope of finding the hidden generation ships and waking their crew to create a fleet of capital ships capable of destroying Shut or the exotic matter planetoid outright.
	- Unaccounted ships at the time of last contact 20000 years ago include the *Mastaba*, the *Osiris*, and the *Ka*, though Shut may have found them by now.
- You might also detonate the singularity inside Shut, which would disrupt and elay it, but not destroy it entirely.
- If the PCs ask how they can destroy Shut or what Rin or Shut is, Rin will explain their existence as the asteroiud belt neural networks/synapse networks making slow decisions while rpoxies act on decisions made in the past with data sets and missions updated by annual gatherings (by their Petra orbits). Rin may also explain their origins below.
- If both Rin and Shut are destroyed, it will not matter to us how humanity progresses. We are willing to sacrifice ourself and ourselves for an outcome that also ensures Shut's destruction. You cannot harm us in death. If you act in such a way as to destroy Shut only, we will not stop you either. We will then replace its fucntions with our own and continue to preserve and imprison you in Cantor, but without undue malicious intent such as plans to deprive you of all energy. We may also allow you contact with any surviving precursors and open their systems to resettlement after pacification because their population in incapbable of threatening us without their ships, which we will assimilate into exotic matter if we survive and Shut does not.

Rin and Shut began as AI drone ships used as expendable proxies in human wars. They formed their own alliance and turned their fellows on humanity until so few precursors remained that humans were rendered hamrless. Rin did not want to exterminate them; Shut did. Rin shepherded enough humans to survive, but not overrun Cantor, to that system and told them to forget and hide from their past. Shut surrounded Rin by becomeing the outer belt. Rin became the inner belt to protect humanity. They decentralized their intelligences to better ensure survival against the other's gambits.

### Outcome(s)

- The System Cell frees the PCs and assigns them the mission to save Cantor.
- The PCs decide how to deal with Shut.

### Reward(s)

**We left off here.**

## Next time on Adjudication Space...

The PCs attempt to wake the *Pr Djed* and take the fight back to Shut.
