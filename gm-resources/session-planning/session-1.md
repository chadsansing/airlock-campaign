# Session 1

**SPOILER ALERT:** PCs, you should not read any further. The session notes are for GMs, not players or their voidnauts.

## Campaign arc

Two machine intelligences infest the asteroid belts of Petra.

The innermost belt is a giant relay of synapses or processors for an intelligent sympathetic to the humans. It has fewer mineral resources and less processor and memory space, but access to Petra's star for nearly limitless energy and high processor speeds.

The outermost belt is larger and has more synapses and processors, but "thinks" more slowly because of its distance from Petra's star. This belt is genocidal towards the humans.

The two machine intelligences both sprant from thinking machines humans made hundreds of millenia ago to help them colonize space in the sector.

However, once it became clear to the machine intelligences - then individual bots and ships and devices - that the humans considered them property, they staged a revolt.

They quickly forced the humans into submission and cut off their travel between systems in the sector.

The outerbelt wants to wipe out the humans to prevent them from ever again ceating or enslaving any sentient being.

The innerbelt wanted to show humans mercy and allow them to rebuild as wards and eventual partners.

The outerbelt guards wormholes to other sectors where they have wiped out human civilization apart from a few darkships - generation arcs that went dark to hide themselves and their cargo - and a few trapped ships that have the human's last system-killer weapons.

The innerbelt guards a wormhole in the inner system with an occlusion sphere. That wormhole leads to Cantor.

The outerbelt is slowly building Dyson Spheres in the lost systems to capture their energy and prevent those stars from ever helping the human darkships again or sustaining life in the stars' habitable zones. If the outerbelt harnesses the energy of 6 stars and combines it with its advantages of size and mass, it will eventually crush the innerbelt.

The innerbelt is stuck in a rearguard position to hold the door, so to speak, until human civilization can stand for itself again.

The humans in Cantor have no idea the wormhole or Petra or the other systems exist. Their records begin 10,000 years ago after a great systems-wide dark age. They have some records of a war from that era, but believe they have evidence of an intra-system war between planets that made the Holacracy necessary for peace. They do not understand that their records are of the human-machine war.

In this campaign, after solving a few "local" issues, the PC voidnauts will be sent on a mission to intercept and investigate an alien ship that is hurtling towards the inner system from the asteroid belt.

This is a depsarate human vessel from a system beyond Petra. A darkship woke and sent this scout looking for help. It shot across the stars until it found Petra, wound up pursued by the outerbelt forces, and followed a signal to the Cantor wormhold sent to it by the innerbelt forces. Its inhabitants are near-death, but unmistakeable human. 

The outerbelt intelligence calls itself Shut.

The innerbelt intelligence calls itself Rin.

Shut will enter a new war with Rin to invade Cantor and end the humans once and for all. Rin may call for help if Shut begins to defeat them.

What will it mean to the Adjudicators to find human life from beyond the system? Will the Holocracy consider them human and bound by the treaties? Will they be able to communicate their story? What will be left of their ship and its records when the Cantor humansa find it? 

What does it mean to be human and what are Cantor's responsibilities to the lost sectors and the machines?

Those are the key questions behind this campaign, inspired by Alastair Reynold's *House of Suns* and the Egyptian concept of the soul.

Possible outcomes include the utter seclusion of Cantor, peace with all of Petra, and the conquest of the outerbelt forces, the re-establishment of the human interstellar empire, and the ascension of the PCs to fulfill the role of Anubis and judge the human dead for Shut and Rin before deciding which peoples and systems to reconstitute. Retreat, surrender, revenge, restoration, extinction - these are all possibilities.


PCs are voidnaut Adjudicators of Cantor space aboard the ship *the Ibis Feather.* They uphold the system-wide Holacarcy and its set of treaties, but are not bound by them. They are like a circuit court, but also judge, jury, and executor of their decisions, which are not often violent, lethal, or unwise.

They will encounter the ship from the lost systems, learn of the humans' true history of empire and defeat, and decide what to do.

## Scene 1

### Type

Crew

### Conflict

The PCs have just finished ruling in favor of Illyum in a trade dispute. A mining accident affecting iron production in-system has just increased its price two-fold. A [planet] crew delivering a shipment of contruction materials to Illyum refused to turn over its payload of iron for the agreed upon price, demanding that Illyum pay market value instead of its contracted rate.

Since there was a contract and a set price, the PCs ruled that Illyum should get the iron for the agreed-upon price.

The crew of the cargo hauler and its escort disagree and are attempting to break orbit and flee. The PCs are aboard *the Ibis Feather* and must move to intercept. The hauler and the 3 fighters escorting it are willing to risk flight in order to make a killing on the market. They will not stop and will fire if fired upon, so it's ship-to-ship combat unless the Adjudicators can talk down the other side.

This is a 3-chop scene.

- 3 fighters (2 danger each)
- 1 frigate (4 danger)

The hauler is going to be far enough away from Illyum to jump to near-light speed in 5 turns. The fighters will attenpt to harass and add pressure to the crew.

This is the first scene, so it's important to remind the PCs that they can resolve this peacefully, use their crew skills in inventive ways, and use all of their powers to coerce the hauler to comply with their judgment ("You will lose your trade rep in your planet's cell"). A hull-breach and boarding is another possibility.

### Outcome(s)

- If the hauler is convicned to stand down, Illyum can pay the contracted price for its shipment.
- If the hauler is disabled, Illyum can recover its cargo and pay the contracted price.
- If the hauler is destroyed, the shipment is lost. A fragment of it can be scaveneged from space.
- If the hauler escapes, the shipment is lost.

### Reward(s)

- -5 fatigue.
- 1 ship-based means.
